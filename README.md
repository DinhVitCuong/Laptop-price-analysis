# Laptop Price Analysis

This is the final project for DS105, where we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and evaluation on laptop prices.

## Overview

In this project, we analyze a dataset of laptop prices to uncover key trends and insights. Our goal is to explore the relationship between various features (such as brand, processor, RAM, and more) and the pricing of laptops. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and evaluation of factors influencing the prices.
